# tic-tac-toe

A just-for-fun [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) application implementing "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe" [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe).

### Run application:

Requires [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), though I'm planning to play around with deploying on heroku or somewhere else free eventually. Clone the repository, then in the repository's directory:

```
lein clean
lein prod
```

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:8280](http://localhost:8280).
